The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

==># Read two integers from input
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

# Print the sum with the expression
print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")

# Print the difference with the expression
print(f"{a} - {b} = {a - b}")

# Print the product with the expression
print(f"{a} * {b} = {a * b}")

==>5, 3
5 + 3 = 8
5 - 3 = 2
5 * 3 = 15
