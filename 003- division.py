Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division. 
The second line should contain the result of float division.

==>  a = int(input())
    b = int(input())

print(a // b)  # Integer division
print(a / b)   # Float division
==>5, 2
integer division = 2
float division = 2.5
