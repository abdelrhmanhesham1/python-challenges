Consider the following:

A string, s, of length n where s = c0c1...cn-1
An integer, k, where k is a factor of n
We can split s into n/k subsegments where each subsegment, ti, consists of a contiguous block of k characters in s. Then, use each ti to create string ui such that:

The characters in ui are a subsequence of the characters in ti
Any repeat occurrence of a character is removed from the string such that each character in ui occurs exactly once. In other words, if the character at some index j in ti occurs at a previous index < j in ti, then do not include the character in string ui
Given s and k, print n/k lines where each line i denotes string ui

Input Format
The first line contains a single string denoting s.
The second line contains an integer, k, denoting the length of each subsegment.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 104, where n is the length of s
1 <= k <= n
It is guaranteed that n is a multiple of k

Output Format
Print n/k lines where each line i contains string ui

==>def merge_the_tools(string, k):    
    subs = [string[i:i+k] if i+k <= len(string) else string[i:] for i in range(0, len(string), k)]
    uniques = []
    for sub in subs:
        u = ""
        for char in sub:
            if char not in u:
                u = u + char
        uniques.append(u)
    print("\n".join(uniques))
if __name__ == '__main__':
    string, k = input(), int(input())
    merge_the_tools(string, k)

==>1. The function **splits** the input string into substrings of length k.  
2. It iterates through each substring and removes duplicate characters while maintaining order.  
3. A new string `u` is created for each substring, adding characters only if they haven't appeared before.  
4. These processed substrings are stored in a list and printed line by line.  
5. The program reads input, calls the function, and prints the transformed substrings.
